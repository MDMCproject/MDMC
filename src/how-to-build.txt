Using ordinary Makefiles - targeted for linux:
1) make sure xmlf90_sax library is compiled first by going to
trunk/src/xmlf90_sax/sax and using linux type 'make'
2) make sure xmlf90_wxml library is compiled first by going to
trunk/src/xmlf90_sax/wxml and using linux type 'make'
3) make sure xmlf90_xpath library is compiled first by going to
trunk/src/xmlf90_sax/xpath and using linux type 'make'
4) go to the trunk/src directory. Type 'make'

Using SCONS makefiles (out of date and in need of considerably updating before use):
1) go to the trunk/src directory and type 'scons'. You may have to edit the 
SConstruct file first so that only the library is build to start with.
